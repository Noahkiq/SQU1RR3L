There's currently no toggle for this, aside from just deleting/creating the channel.\r\n\r\n### Contributors\r\n@Julien12150 made most of *userinfoinfo and helped with some other things.\r\n\r\n### SQU1RR3L Hub\r\nYou can join the SQU1RR3L Hub discord server to suggest new features or report issues.
